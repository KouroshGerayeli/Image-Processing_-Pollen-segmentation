# Image-Processing_-Pollen-segmentation
Pollen segmentation

Goal : extract automatically each taxon of pollen
Same image acquired with 2 different lightnings

Data : sets of images are provided in two different lightnings
Methods : two segmentation models are provided :
1. Our algorithm using (watershed, k-means clustering etc).
2. SAM ( Segment anything model ) by facebook is used as the reference model in order to confirm the first algorithm.
